## About Me
My name is Jingrui Wang, and I am a graduate student in cyberspace security at Changchun University. Before pursuing my graduate studies, I obtained my undergraduate degree at school of cyberspace security, [Hangzhou Dianzi University](https://www.hdu.edu.cn/main.htm). I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Zhen Wang](https://cbs.hdu.edu.cn/2022/0909/c3446a156649/page.htm). During my undergraduate studies, I developed a passion for Spacial Evolutionary Game Theory, which led me to pursue further research in Computational Social Science. You can find my CV [here](../files/cv.pdf).

## Research Interest
My research interests include Computational Social Science, Computational Communication, Spacial Evolutionary Game Theory,  Network Science and Epidemic Spreading. <b>I am particularly interested in Computational Social Science</b>. I have had the opportunity to work on several research projects during my time in graduate school, you can read more details on my [<b>publications page</b>](https://wangjingrui530.github.io/publications), which have allowed me to develop my skills in Machine Learning, Game Theory, Multi-agent Simulation, Network Science, etc.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to you getting to know me better. I am excited to discussing potential collaboration opportunities with you. If our research interests align and I would like to explore the possibility of collaborating with you on a research project.
