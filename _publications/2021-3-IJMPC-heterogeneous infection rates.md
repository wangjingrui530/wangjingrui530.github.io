Here, we propose an improved SIS model with heterogeneity in infection rates, proportional to the degree of nodes. By conducting simulations, we illustrate that almost all vaccinated nodes have high degrees when the infection rate is positively correlated with the degree of a node. These vaccinated nodes can divide the whole network into many connected sub-graphs, which significantly slows down the propagation of an epidemic; the heterogeneity of infection rates has a strong inhibitory effect on epidemic transmission. On the other hand, when the infection rate is negatively related to the degrees of the infection rate nodes, it is difficult for most nodes to meet the inoculation conditions, and the number of inoculations is close to zero.
