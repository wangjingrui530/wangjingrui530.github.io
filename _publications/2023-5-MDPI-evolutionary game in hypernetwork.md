title: "The Evolution of Cooperation in Multigames with Uniform Random Hypergraphs"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'How to explain the emergence of cooperative behavior remains a significant problem. As players may hold diverse perceptions on a particular dilemma, the concept of multigames has been introduced. Therefore, a multigame is studied within various binary networks. Since group structures are common in human society and a person can participate in multiple groups, this paper studies an evolutionary multigame with high-order interaction properties.
**<br>This paper is produced by the undergraduate students under the guidance of the research group. I am the second corresponding author.**'

How to explain the emergence of cooperative behavior remains a significant problem. As players may hold diverse perceptions on a particular dilemma, the concept of multigames has been introduced. Therefore, a multigame is studied within various binary networks. Since group structures are common in human society and a person can participate in multiple groups, this paper studies an evolutionary multigame with high-order interaction properties. For this purpose, a uniform random hypergraph is adopted as the network structure, allowing players to interact with all nodes in the same hyperedge. First, we investigate the effect of the multigame payoff matrix differences on the evolution of cooperation and find that increasing the differences in the payoff matrix promotes cooperation on the hypergraph network. Second, we discover that an increase in the average hyperdegree of the hypergraph network promotes network reciprocity, wherein high-hyperdegree nodes influence surrounding nodes to form a cooperator cluster. Conversely, groups with a low hyperdegree are more susceptible to betrayal, leading to a decline in cooperation.
